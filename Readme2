Repository contains a PNG of the Entity Relationship Diagram, which was created using the Quick Database Diagrams app, and two .sql files. 

The "table schemata" .sql file contains the code used to build the data tables and relationships. After mapping out how everything would connect the tables had to be created in the correct order to make sure like fields are properly mapped.
Then from there, with the 6 tables created, I loaded in the provided .CSV files to the tables.

The "queries" .sql file contains all of the code used to perform the analysis section of the assignment. 

The assignment mentioned Jupyter notebook and bonus analysis but I saw no details on what is being asked, so I didn't include anything else.
